# Memory Game Project

This is the second project from the **Udacity Front End Nanodegree**. It's a classic game built with only HTML, CSS, and vanilla (pure, no libraries or frameworks) JavaScript, it's also 100% responsive and focus on DOM manipulation. It features a panel with statistics of the current instance of play and a modal with the final score.

## How to Play

- There are eight matched card pairs in shuffled positions.
- Click a card to reveal it, then repeat for a second card.
- If the cards match, they keep facing-up and if not, they are turned back down.
- The objective is to find all eight pairs of cards.
- The less moves and time you take, the better!
- Good luck!
